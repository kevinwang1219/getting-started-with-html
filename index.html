    In my first week of udacity, I learned how to <b> bold</b>.
<br> I also learned to how to start a new line
<p> as well as paragraph </p>
Another cool thing I learned is how to <a href="www.udacity.com">link </a>
<br> I also have a better understanding how the web works.
<br> My home PC sends data to the web, then it sends it to the servers.
<br> From the server it sends info back to my computer.
<p> Also learned computers take everything in literal terms </p>
